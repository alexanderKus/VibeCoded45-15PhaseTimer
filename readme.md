# 📘 Project Description: 45/15 Phase Timer with Sound & Visual Alerts

This is a simple web-based timer tool designed for repetitive work/rest intervals:

    ⏱ 45-second Work Phase followed by a 15-second Break Phase

    🔁 Loops automatically forever once started

    🔊 Beep sound alerts at the end of each phase

    🌈 Background flash (green for work, red for break) when a new phase begins

    ⌨️ Starts only when the user presses the spacebar, satisfying browser audio policies

Useful for:

    Focus sessions (Pomodoro-like)

    Exercise/rest intervals

    Timed practice or drills

No dependencies, works entirely in the browser.
